# Data-Structures
This is the second core class in my Computer Science major at Berea College. I took this course in the Fall of 2014. 

Throughout the majority of the class we focused on expanding our use of the python coding language. Towards the end of the class we started to work with C++. 

Throughout this course we learned about how to code various data structures in python, as well as the uses of recursion and classes. 

Many assignments have been completed using good paired programming practices that have been outlined by my professors.
